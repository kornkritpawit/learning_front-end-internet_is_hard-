    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
        headings.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered lisst)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        <li>
            <p>Paragrapg in list -> Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You shoule be noricing things is this precise order, because this is
            an ordered list
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
        phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
        of a word or phrases.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>This paragraph needs some space below it...</p>
    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p>So, I added some hard line breaks.</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crpa, but we'll fix that with some CSS
        soon.
